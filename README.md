Subpy
=====

Subpy is a library for defining subsets of the Python language
and querying ASTs for language-level properties.

Many projects aim to work with specific subsets of Python that
are amenable to *static analysis* and *type inference*, subpy is
simply a utility library for checking for subsets.

Usage
-----

The input to the ``checker`` can be either a Module, Function or
source code as string. It returns a dictionary of lists keyed by
the ``feature`` and the values with the line numbers where the
feature is detected. 

```python
>>> from subpy import checker
>>> import io

>>> print checker(io)

{3: [98],
 5: [78, 81, 84, 87],
 9: [78, 81, 84, 87],
 10: [81, 84, 87],
 32: [92, 96],
 34: [79]}
```

Matching the feature codes with the keys in the dictionary we see
the information this is telling us:

* A *delete* is used on line 98.
* A *class* is used on line 78, 81, 84, and 87.
* *Inheritance* is used on line 78, 81, 84, and 87.
* *Multiple inheritance* is used on line 81, 84, and 87.
* A *custom iterator* is used on line 92 and 96.
* A *metaclass* is used on line 79.

A example using the function level checker:

```python
from subpy import checker
from subpy.features import ListComp

def comps():
    return [x**2 for x in range(25)]

def nocomp():
    return 'hello'

features = checker(comps)

if ListComp in features:
    print 'You used a list comprehension on lines %r' % (features[ListComp])

features = checker(nocomp)

if ListComp not in features:
    print 'You did not use any list comprehensions!'

```

The ``validator`` command can be used to raise when unsupported
features are detected in the given source.

```python
from subpy import validator, FeatureNotSupported
from subpy.features import ListComp, SetComp

def comps():
    return [x**2 for x in range(25)]

my_excluded_subset = set([
    ListComp,
    SetComp,
])

validator(comps)
```

```python
  File "<stdin>", line 2
    return [x**2 for x in range(25)]
            ^
subpy.validate.FeatureNotSupported: ListComp
```
